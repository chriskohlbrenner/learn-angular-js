 - initialize angular app using "ng-app" directive (looks liek html attribute)
 - what's a binding? Anything in {{}}?
    - "Data-binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, as well as updating the model whenever the view changes. This is awesome because it eliminates DOM manipulation from the list of things you have to worry about." (https://angularjs.org/)


  Process
  - started with hello.html
      very basic "hello world" example
      immediately display input (can be done using jQuery, but is different--rewatch video for specific differences)
  - todo.html
      more complicated
      gets into bindings, calling functions
      not just ng-model, but ng-controller and ng-click
